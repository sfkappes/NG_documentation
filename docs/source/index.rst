    This page is soon to be the Nightingale official documentation page, but right now the documentation is undergoing its final revisions before deployemnt.  Users, please refer to the `wiki documentation <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/USSPPRT/Nightingale+Cluster+User+Guide>`_ until we officially transfer the documentation (at which point this notice will disappear).  This documentation will hopefully transition to official in late August, 2022.  

.. note::

   Status notices go here.  There are no upcoming maintenance windows in the immediate future.  

NCSA Nightingale Documentation
=========================================================

The **Nightingale Cluster** is a high-performance environment within the Advanced Computational Health Enclave (ACHE). The ACHE is a unique environment with restricted physical and electronic access. All electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) processed or stored at NCSA is done within this environment. The Nightingale Cluster system seeks to expand the ACHE to provide a multi-tenant campus cluster-like environment to meet the needs of researchers who wish to process and store ePHI.
